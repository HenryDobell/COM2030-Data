Mt. Mansfield, Vermont - February, 2005

Semi-Proffessional skier Alec Stall has set off an avalanche near the peak of Vermont's tallest mountain. 
This torrent of snow will pull him over a cliff and tragically take his life.
Even today, this is still the only avalanche death in Vermont recorded by the Colorado Avalanche Infromation Center. 
Despite this incident's isolation in the Green Mountain State, it is still a sobering reminder that snow sports can be dangerous anywhere.
